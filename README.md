# HAKI Playground

- This is the experimental cross-platform+ VR version of the different Haki-Unity test- and research projects.

### Built With
- C#
- C++
- HLSL

### Project Setup
```sh
1. Start by cloning the project into your chosen project folder with either SSH or HTTPS.
2. Open the root folder of the project with Unity Hub to set up the Unity project.
3. Install the appropriate Unity version which will be prompted upon starting the project.
4. If there are errors in Unity or modified files in your IDE, close the IDE. 
5. In Unity, we need to reimport all the project files, Assets -> Reimport All (Or Right Click in the Assets Folder)
6. After Unity has finished reimporting, both the Unity project and your IDE should be working accordingly.
```
